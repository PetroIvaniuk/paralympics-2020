Thanks for checking out my app! It was built entirely using 
[matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) and 
[Tokyo 2020 Paralympics](https://www.kaggle.com/piterfm/tokyo-2020-paralympics) data.

This application is a dashboard that runs an analysis of Tokyo 2020 Paralympics results.
You can find all medals and medalists distributions with the possibility 
to look into country and/or discipline. 

Flags pictures from [SOURCE FLAGS](https://github.com/linuxmint/flags).

If you are interested in sport data you can check
